  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p style="font-family:cafeteria">Ivan Sabar (Or Phantom Parasite as he's called online) is a freelance digital artist and writer currently working independently on the online illustrated novel, AfterEarth. Ivan first began drawing digitally in 2020 after he acquired his own drawing tablet. His personal works consist of character designing and backgrounds. Some of his drawn backgrounds can be seen on the webcomic, Temptation vs Tranquility by NetherPearl33 on Tapas.

  Ivan is among the more introverted types, having not interacted with many of his peers and teachers doing his high school years. That has not, however, stopped him from pursuing his education and training himself to be more accustomed to social situations whenever they're required. He's a huge fan of the Plants vs Zombies franchise, which would soon grow to inspire some of his works.
